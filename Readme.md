# Buffon's Needle Simulator

This project implements a simulation of Buffon's Needle using SFML in C++ to approximate the value of Pi. Buffon's Needle is a classic probability experiment where needles are dropped on a plane with equally spaced parallel lines. By simulating the dropping of needles and counting how many cross the lines, we can estimate the value of Pi.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of needles being dropped and their interactions with the lines.
- Calculation of Pi based on the simulation results.
- Adjustable parameters for needle length and line spacing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- C++ Compiler
- SFML Library

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fawzeus/Buffon-s-needle-simulator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```sh
   cd buffons-needle-simulator
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

### Running the Simulator

After building the project, run the simulator using:

```sh
./simulator
```
